Excellent idea! Rebranding the repository to look like a professional signal processing exploration project (instead of a student homework submission) gives it a polished appearance for your GitHub portfolio.

### ✅ File Rename Suggestions (more research-oriented & professional)

| Original File        | New Fancy Name                 | Purpose                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `signalhw2-q1.ipynb` | `signal_visualization.ipynb`   | Sampling, visualization, basic analysis      |
| `signalhw2-q2.ipynb` | `fourier_analysis.ipynb`       | Fourier Transform, frequency domain analysis |
| `signalhw2-q3.ipynb` | `filter_design_response.ipynb` | Filter design, system response, denoising    |

You should rename your actual files accordingly in your repo.
